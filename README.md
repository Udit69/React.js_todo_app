# MERN Todo Application

The MERN Todo Application is a full-stack task management tool developed using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This application allows users to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing tasks.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely to access their personalized task lists.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed, providing visual feedback on the status of each task.
- **Filtering:** Tasks can be filtered based on their completion status (All, Active, Completed).
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and can be accessed on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing task data.
- **Express.js:** A Node.js web application framework used for building the backend server.
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library used for building the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code.
- **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Bootstrap or Material-UI:** Optional for styling and UI components.
